## Sequence Diagrams for the Todo App

### User Login Sequence Diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend

    User->>Frontend: Sends login credentials
    Frontend->>Backend: Sends login request
    Backend->>Backend: Validates credentials
    Backend->>Frontend: Sends authentication token (if successful)
    Frontend->>User: Displays success message or error
```

### User Task Creation Sequence Diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Creates new task
    Frontend->>Backend: Sends POST request with task details
    Backend->>Database: Stores task in database
    Database->>Backend: Confirms task creation
    Backend->>Frontend: Sends success response
    Frontend->>User: Displays success message and updated task list
```

### User Task Update Sequence Diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Selects task to edit
    Frontend->>Backend: Sends PUT request with updated task details
    Backend->>Database: Updates task in database
    Database->>Backend: Confirms update
    Backend->>Frontend: Sends success response
    Frontend->>User: Displays updated task list
```

### User Task Deletion Sequence Diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Selects task to delete
    Frontend->>Backend: Sends DELETE request with task ID
    Backend->>Database: Deletes task from database
    Database->>Backend: Confirms deletion
    Backend->>Frontend: Sends success response
    Frontend->>User: Removes task from UI
```

**Note:** These are simplified sequence diagrams. In a real-world application, you might have additional steps like error handling, data validation, and security checks. You can also add more detailed interactions, such as database queries and network requests.

By creating sequence diagrams, you can visualize the flow of interactions between different components of your system and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
