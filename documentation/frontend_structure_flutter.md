## Flutter App Project Structure

**Here's a suggested project structure for your Flutter todo app:**

```
todo_app/
  lib/
    main.dart
    models/
      task_model.dart
      user_model.dart
    screens/
      home_screen.dart
      login_screen.dart
      signup_screen.dart
      task_detail_screen.dart
    services/
      api_service.dart
      auth_service.dart
      local_storage_service.dart
    utils/
      constants.dart
      themes.dart
    widgets/
      task_list_item.dart
      custom_button.dart
      custom_text_field.dart
  test/
    widget_test.dart
    unit_test.dart
  pubspec.yaml
```

**Explanation:**

* **lib/main.dart:** The entry point of the app.
* **lib/models/:** Defines the data models for tasks and users.
* **lib/screens/:** Contains the different screens of the app (home, login, signup, task detail).
* **lib/services/:** Handles network requests, authentication, and local storage.
* **lib/utils/:** Stores constants, themes, and other utility functions.
* **lib/widgets/:** Reusable UI components.
* **test/:** Contains unit and widget tests.
* **pubspec.yaml:** The project's configuration file.

**Key Points:**

* **State Management:** Use a state management solution like Provider or Riverpod to manage the app's state, such as the list of tasks, user authentication, and app settings.
* **Network Requests:** Use the `http` package to make API requests to the backend.
* **Local Storage:** Use the `shared_preferences` package to store user preferences and other data locally.
* **UI Components:** Design reusable UI components to improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy.
* **Testing:** Write unit and widget tests to ensure the quality and reliability of your app.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle network errors, API errors, and other exceptions.
* **User Experience:** Prioritize a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and clear feedback.

By following this structure and considering the key points, you can build a robust and well-organized Flutter app for your todo list.
